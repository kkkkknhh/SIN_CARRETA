# ReliabilityCalibrator Integration in Stage 15 QUESTIONNAIRE_EVAL

## Overview

The `ReliabilityCalibrator` from `evaluation/reliability_calibration.py` has been successfully integrated into the `questionnaire_engine.py` Stage 15 QUESTIONNAIRE_EVAL processing flow. This integration applies Bayesian reliability calibration to all 300 questions, providing calibrated scores with uncertainty quantification.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Import and Initialization

**Import Statement** (line 17):
```python
from evaluation.reliability_calibration import ReliabilityCalibrator
```

**Calibrator Initialization** in `QuestionnaireEngine.__init__()` (lines 1298-1303):
```python
# Initialize ReliabilityCalibrator for Stage 15 QUESTIONNAIRE_EVAL
self.reliability_calibrator = ReliabilityCalibrator(
    detector_name="questionnaire_evaluator",
    precision_a=5.0,  # Prior: α=5 (moderately informative)
    precision_b=1.0,  # Prior: β=1
    recall_a=5.0,     # Prior: α=5
    recall_b=1.0,     # Prior: β=1
)
```

**Prior Parameters Rationale**:
- **Beta(α=5.0, β=1.0)**: This represents a moderately informative prior that encodes the belief that the questionnaire evaluator has reasonably high precision and recall (~83% expected value).
- The priors are weakly informative, allowing data to dominate the posterior after sufficient updates.
- These values can be adjusted based on empirical validation data.

### 2. Enhanced EvaluationResult Data Structure

**New Fields Added** (lines 164-165):
```python
@dataclass
class EvaluationResult:
    # ... existing fields ...
    calibrated_score: Optional[float] = None  # Bayesian-calibrated score
    uncertainty: Optional[float] = None        # Uncertainty metric (credible interval width)
    metadata: Dict[str, Any] = field(default_factory=dict)
```

### 3. Calibration Logic in Question Evaluation

**Location**: `_evaluate_question_with_evidence()` method (lines 2270-2343)

**Calibration Steps**:

1. **Raw Score Computation** (lines 2272-2275):
   ```python
   raw_score = self._calculate_score(
       elements_found_count, expected_count, base_question.scoring_rule
   )
   ```

2. **Normalization** (line 2279):
   ```python
   normalized_raw = raw_score / base_question.max_score  # [0, 1] range
   ```

3. **Bayesian Calibration Application** (lines 2282-2287):
   ```python
   expected_reliability = self.reliability_calibrator.expected_f1
   calibrated_normalized = normalized_raw * expected_reliability
   calibrated_score = calibrated_normalized * base_question.max_score
   ```

4. **Uncertainty Quantification** (lines 2289-2299):
   ```python
   precision_ci = self.reliability_calibrator.precision_credible_interval(level=0.95)
   recall_ci = self.reliability_calibrator.recall_credible_interval(level=0.95)
   
   precision_width = precision_ci[1] - precision_ci[0]
   recall_width = recall_ci[1] - recall_ci[0]
   uncertainty = (precision_width + recall_width) / 2.0
   ```

5. **Recommendation Based on Calibrated Score** (lines 2309-2315):
   ```python
   if calibrated_score >= 2.5:
       recommendation = "Cumple satisfactoriamente"
   elif calibrated_score >= 1.5:
       recommendation = "Cumple parcialmente, requiere mejoras"
   else:
       recommendation = "No cumple, requiere atención prioritaria"
   ```

### 4. Evidence Registration

**Calibration Evidence Tracking** (lines 2318-2323):
```python
calibration_evidence = {
    "source": "reliability_calibrator",
    "type": "bayesian_calibration",
    "confidence": expected_reliability,
    "content_summary": f"Raw score: {raw_score:.2f}, Calibrated: {calibrated_score:.2f}, Uncertainty: {uncertainty:.3f}, F1: {expected_reliability:.3f}",
}
evidence_details.append(calibration_evidence)
```

This ensures that:
- Every question's evaluation includes evidence that calibration was applied
- The calibration parameters (F1, uncertainty) are recorded
- Full traceability of the calibration process is maintained

### 5. Output Structure Enhancement

**EvaluationResult Return** (lines 2325-2343):
```python
return EvaluationResult(
    # ... existing fields ...
    score=raw_score,  # Original raw score preserved
    calculation_detail=f"Found {elements_found_count}/{expected_count} elements | Raw: {raw_score:.2f} → Calibrated: {calibrated_score:.2f} (±{uncertainty:.3f})",
    calibrated_score=round(calibrated_score, 2),
    uncertainty=round(uncertainty, 3),
)
```

**Key Points**:
- **Raw score preserved**: The original `score` field maintains the raw score for transparency
- **Calibrated score added**: New `calibrated_score` field contains the Bayesian-adjusted value
- **Uncertainty quantified**: The `uncertainty` field provides ±error bounds
- **Enhanced calculation detail**: The `calculation_detail` string shows the full transformation pipeline

## Coverage: All 300 Questions

The calibration is applied universally in the `_evaluate_question_with_evidence()` method, which is called for **every question** in the evaluation pipeline:

1. **30 base questions** × **10 thematic points** = **300 questions**
2. Each question passes through the calibration pipeline
3. All 300 questions receive:
   - Bayesian-calibrated score
   - Uncertainty quantification
   - Calibration evidence registration

## Usage Example

### Accessing Calibration Results

```python
from questionnaire_engine import QuestionnaireEngine, EvidenceRegistry

# Initialize engine
engine = QuestionnaireEngine()

# Prepare evidence registry
evidence_registry = EvidenceRegistry()
# ... populate evidence ...
evidence_registry.freeze()

# Execute evaluation
results = engine.execute_full_evaluation_parallel(
    evidence_registry=evidence_registry,
    municipality="Test Municipality",
    department="Test Department",
)

# Access calibrated scores
for question in results["results"]["all_questions"]:
    print(f"Question: {question['question_id']}")
    print(f"  Raw Score: {question['score']:.2f}")
    print(f"  Calibrated Score: {question['calibrated_score']:.2f}")
    print(f"  Uncertainty: ±{question['uncertainty']:.3f}")
    print(f"  F1 Reliability: {engine.reliability_calibrator.expected_f1:.3f}")
```

### Updating Calibrator with Ground Truth

The `ReliabilityCalibrator` can be updated with ground truth data to refine its reliability estimates:

```python
import numpy as np

# After collecting ground truth annotations
y_true = np.array([1, 1, 0, 1, 0, ...])  # Ground truth labels
y_pred = np.array([1, 1, 0, 0, 0, ...])  # Predicted labels

# Update calibrator
engine.reliability_calibrator.update(y_true, y_pred)

# Get updated statistics
stats = engine.reliability_calibrator.get_stats()
print(f"Updated Precision: {stats['precision']['mean']:.2%}")
print(f"Updated Recall: {stats['recall']['mean']:.2%}")
print(f"Updated F1: {stats['f1']:.2%}")

# Persist updated calibrator
from pathlib import Path
engine.reliability_calibrator.save(Path("calibrators/questionnaire_evaluator.json"))
```

## Benefits

2. **Temporal Tracking**: Monitor calibrator performance degradation over time
3. **Cross-Validation**: Validate calibration effectiveness using held-out data
4. **Active Learning**: Prioritize questions with high uncertainty for manual review
