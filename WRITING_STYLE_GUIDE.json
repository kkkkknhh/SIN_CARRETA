Synthesizing across feasibility_scorer, monetary_detector, and responsibility_detector reveals convergent patterns reducing systematic bias likelihood. The Bayesian posterior analysis yields a mean estimate of 0.83 with 95% credible interval [0.75, 0.90], representing narrow uncertainty indicating high precision in this evaluation component."
